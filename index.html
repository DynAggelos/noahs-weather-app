        <h1>Noah Weather App</h1>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Basic Usage</h3>
        <p>To see upcoming weather straight from <a href="https://www.weather.gov/">Weather.gov</a> (i.e., <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/">NOAA</a>), either:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>type in the coordinates (<code>longitude, latitude</code>) you want to see the weather for into the coordinates textbox below, or</li>
            <li>press the <span class="literal">Use Browser Coordinates</span> button and allow the page to access your location to put your general coordinates in the textbox.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When the textbox contains valid longitude and latitude coordinates, click <span class="literal">Submit Coordinates</span> to see the weather.</p>

        <h3>Saving Coordinates</h3>
        <p>To save your coordinates for future use, make sure they are entered properly into the coordinates box, press <span class="literal">Save These Coordinates</span>, and then bookmark the page after it reloads. Then every time you use the bookmark, the coordinates you "saved" will be automatically loaded into the coordinates textbox for you.</p>

        <h3>About Letting Your Browser Access Your Location</h3>
        <p>This feature uses your IP address to determine your general location. If you have your WiFi on, any WiFi hotspots around you will also probably be used to get a much more exact location. If you don't want to send Weather.gov your exact location (which really is unnecessary anyway), keep your WiFi off when you press the <span class="literal">Use Browser Coordinates</span> button. More information about how the Firefox browser determines your location when you allow it to is found <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/does-firefox-share-my-location-websites">here</a>. Please note that your coordinates are not saved by this app in any way, although your IP address and coordinates may be saved by Repl.it and/or Weather.gov, according to their privacy policies on user data retention.</p>

        <p>This app uses (will use) the US cities database from <a href="https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities">simplemaps.com/data/us-cities</a></p>
